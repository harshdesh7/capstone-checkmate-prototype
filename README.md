This application is purely frontend where the backend has only been completed for the bill split functionality. This scenario is emulating 3 people going out to eat, where you are in the point of view of 1 of these people. You order a dish, and the 2 dishes the other people ordered also shows up on the total bill.


Instructions:

Must be run on google Chrome.

Download the files and open up base-menu.html, or just click the above link. From there, scroll down the menu until you find Alfredo Williams dish. Click on it, and select garlic bread as a side. Then add this to the plate. After that, click on the plate icon in the top right corner to view the dish you just added. Click the “send to kitchen” button, which means your order has gone through. At this point, you can click the “pay bill” button, which will take you to the active component of our application. Here, you can test out the bill split feature, or you can select the whole bill to pay for easily using the “select all” button. Once you are satisfied with the way the bill has been split, press”submit payment” and you are done.
